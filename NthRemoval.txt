#Problem

19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

Hint
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

 

Example 1:


Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Example 2:

Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is sz.
1 <= sz <= 30
0 <= Node.val <= 100
1 <= n <= sz
 

Follow up: Could you do this in one pass?


#SOLUTION

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    # Removed the : Optional[ListNode] and -> Optional[ListNode]
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        # 1. Use a dummy node to simplify edge cases
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        fast = dummy
        slow = dummy
        
        # 2. Advance fast pointer so that there is a gap of n
        for _ in range(n):
            if fast:
                fast = fast.next
            
        # 3. Move both until fast reaches the end
        while fast and fast.next:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next
            
        # 4. Skip the target node
        if slow.next:
            slow.next = slow.next.next
            
        return dummy.next
