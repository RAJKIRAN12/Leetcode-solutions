#PROBLEM
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.
 
Example 1:
Input: s = "abcabcbb"Output: 3Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. Note that "bca" and "cab" are also correct answers.
Example 2:
Input: s = "bbbbb"Output: 1Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:
Input: s = "pwwkew"Output: 3Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 
Constraints:
0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.


#SOLUTION
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
        char_map = {}  # char : last_seen_index
        left = 0
        max_length = 0
        
        for right in range(len(s)):
            char = s[right]
            
            # If char is in map and inside the current window
            if char in char_map and char_map[char] >= left:
                # Move left pointer to jump past the duplicate
                left = char_map[char] + 1
            
            # Update the last seen index of the character
            char_map[char] = right
            
            # Calculate current window size and update max
            max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
            
        return max_length
