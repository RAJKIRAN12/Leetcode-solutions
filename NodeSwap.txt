#PROBLEM

24. Swap Nodes in Pairs

Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

 

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4]

Output: [2,1,4,3]

Explanation:



Example 2:

Input: head = []

Output: []

Example 3:

Input: head = [1]

Output: [1]

Example 4:

Input: head = [1,2,3]

Output: [2,1,3]

 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 100

#SOLUTION

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head):
        # Dummy node to handle head changes easily
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        prev = dummy
        
        # We need at least two nodes to perform a swap
        while prev.next and prev.next.next:
            # Nodes to be swapped
            first = prev.next
            second = prev.next.next
            
            # 1. Point prev to the second node
            prev.next = second
            
            # 2. Point first node to the node after second
            first.next = second.next
            
            # 3. Point second node back to first
            second.next = first
            
            # Move the prev pointer two nodes ahead for the next pair
            prev = first
            
        return dummy.next
